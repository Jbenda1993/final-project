# My Finals Week  Feeling

To be honest, this finals week has been really tough on me. Not due to the workload, or the lack of sleep, but this one simple truth. 
*This is my **last** final ever*  

This has scared me, excited me, made me laugh, made my cry-Just a whole range of mixed emotions. I have loved my time here at UNI, and wish everyone else wells. I am really excited to get through this week and move on with my life, but I know I am going to miss my time here at UNI. 

So when I think about my time here at UNI, and the memories, and my finals I have taken over the last two years of my life at UNI..

#Help me Find It
I can't do this on my own, help me **FIND** it. 
So when I go home, the world will **end** 
Fin.
